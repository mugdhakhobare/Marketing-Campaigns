# Marketing-Campaigns
Marketing campaign dataset, structured around the Four Ps of Marketing: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.
The dataset captures detailed information about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and campaign responses.
Product-related variables represent customer spending across multiple product categories, helping identify top-performing and low-revenue products.
Price-related attributes such as income and deal-based purchases provide insights into customer affordability and price sensitivity.
Place-related variables track purchases across different channels, including web, catalog, and physical stores, reflecting customer shopping preferences and channel behavior.
Promotion-related features measure campaign acceptance, complaints, recency, and engagement, enabling evaluation of marketing effectiveness.
Additionally, demographics support segmentation for personalized marketing. This structured approach helps businesses optimize products, pricing, distribution, and promotions for better customer engagement and market performance.
